# SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This fundamental work emphasizes controlling the complexity of software systems through general techniques common to all engineering design: building abstractions to hide details and to separate specification from implementation, establishing conventional interfaces to allow the creation of standard modules, and shifting modes of linguistic description[...read more](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/course.html)
