* What are Views in Postgresql?
* What are Sequences in Postgresql?
* What is `VACUUM` operation in Postgresql?
* What is the `EXPLAIN` command?
  * What do `ANALYZE` and `BUFFERS` add to command?
  * Why expected cost and actual results can differ?
  * Why do `EXPLAIN` results have tree structure and what are the nodes?
  * Why `cost` and `time` parts of nodes have range structure? What is a start and what is an end?
  * What are `Seq`, `Index`, `Index Only` and `Bitmap` Scans?
    * How do planner choices impact the computer resources consumption?
    * When `Seq Scan` would be the best choice?
