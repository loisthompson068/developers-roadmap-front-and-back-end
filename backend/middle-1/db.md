# Databases for Middle-1

## Questions

* What are base operations for relations?
* What is projection?
* Database normalization:
  * What is the main idea behind the normalization process?
  * What are the conditions for 1NF, 2NF, 3NF?
  * What are the general transformations that help us achieve the normal forms?
  * Normalize this table: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DWWljndtwVSyRbYgKTbDXTnwM1E5ZiLrxwQdGvXm_8/edit?usp=sharing) (use `File->Make a copy` to get an editable copy).
* What are integrity and consistency?
* What is ACID?
* Transactions in PostgreSQL:
  * What is the general idea behind their implementation? (Describe MVCC)
  * Violations of isolation: dirty read, non-repeatable read, phantom read, serialization anomaly. What is their meaning?
  * Isolation levels: Read Uncommited, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable. What anomalies are allowed to happen under these levels?
  * What levels can trigger a serialization failure? How to handle it?
  * What happens when a query is run outside of any transaction?
  * Is it possible to nest transactions?
* What is CAP theorem?
  * Does it work in real world?
  * What combination of CAP guarantees is not encountered in practice?
* What are indexes?
  * How do indexes impact the effectiveness of queries?
  * What are the pros and cons of adding an index?
* What are Views in PostgreSQL?
* What are Sequences in PostgreSQL?
  * How sequences may violate ACID?
* What is `VACUUM` operation in PostgreSQL?
* What is the `EXPLAIN` command?
  * What do `ANALYZE` and `BUFFERS` add to command?
  * Why expected cost and actual results can differ?
  * Why do `EXPLAIN` results have tree structure and what are the nodes?
  * Why `cost` and `time` parts of nodes have range structure? What is a start and what is an end?
  * What are `Seq`, `Index`, `Index Only` and `Bitmap` Scans?
    * How do planner choices impact the computer resources consumption?
    * When `Seq Scan` would be the best choice?
  * How are `Sort`, `Limit` and `HashAggregate` described in `EXPLAIN` output?
  * What are `Nested Loop`, `Merge Join` and `Hash Join`?
    * What is the most effective operation?
    * Should you trust planner choices 100 percent of the times?
  * What do `Result` and `Materialize` in `EXPLAIN` mean?
* Why `count(*)` is usually faster than `count(specific_row)` and `SELECT reltuples FROM pg_class` is even faster?

    * Note: with regards to the hash index, this article talks about an older version of PostgreSQL ([no newer than 9.6](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-types.html)), while in more recent ones ([starting from 10](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/hash-intro.html)), its problems have been solved, and now it's "fully crash recoverable", and thus are completely safe to use.
